It is very useful to contact local associations of visually impaired people to get specific information on healthcare and social assistance in each country.

Daily life with aniridia requires constant adaptation with the environment.  
Some of the challenges are common to those with visual impairment: studying, working, using low vision aids, moving around, traveling and playing sport. Even the most common activities can be very difficult for a visually impaired child or adult in a world where most knowledge and information are conveyed through visual data. The exact causes and consequences of low vision are, in general, not fully understood; people with aniridia may share this difficulty with all visually impaired persons.  

Other problems, however, are specific to aniridia.

Nystagmus, if present, makes it difficult to maintain eye contact and may lead others to think that patients with aniridia are not paying attention. For children in school, this may lead their teachers to think that the child is absent-minded or uninterested, resulting in a wrong appraisal of the pupilâ€™s attention.  

People with aniridia usually find it difficult to adapt to rapidly changing light conditions They may be sensitive to intense light and reflections from windows, mirrors and wet, metallic or white surfaces and often have to adapt their home, work and school environments accordingly.  
Glare caused by reflections may lessen the ability to see details or cause visual discomfort, dry sneezing and headaches. Moving from inside to outside, switching lights on and off, moving in foggy or cloudy days, and crossing in front of car headlamps produce a painful dazzling that reduces visual acuity and causes uncertainty in movement.  

People with aniridia often need to wear sunglasses with highly protective lenses outdoors, which may also be needed on cloudy days or indoors.  
Some people with aniridia can wear contact lenses with an artificial iris and fixed pupil that blocks out the light. Wearing contact lenses includes advantages such as correction of farsightedness or nearsightedness, greater comfort and greater discretion, but requires a constant monitoring of the corneal status. On the other hand, some keratopathies may take advantage from the use of therapeutic contact lenses.
